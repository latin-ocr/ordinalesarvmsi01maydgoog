For these purposes the 19th century contains the year 1800,
but not the year 1900, lor the reason given above ol intercala-
tion before Eastcr; and so sor the others.

These give the new moons in March sor the Golden Number 3.
The Paschal Terms will be 13 days later.

There are still minute errours remaining, both in the Metonic
cycle and in the Calendar, but they do not produce any effect
till the year 4000.

Mln Ι1111 zoth century, the new moon lor Golden Number 3 is
arc 10.

The Golden Number14, being greater by 11, will stand on
the preceding day, March 9.

hThere can be none on March 8, because 14 -l- 11 is greater
t an 19.

Adding 8 to 3. we obtain Golden Number 11, which will
stand against the day but one following, March 12. Similarly
19 stands against March 14 etc.

Hence the following table sor the zoth, 21st, and zznd
centuries, ie. lrorn 1900 to 2199. A similar one can be
constructed sor any other century.
